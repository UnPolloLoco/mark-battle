### Official

- Mark is Bean's father
- Bean - and therefore Mark - are frogs...
- Mark can access other universes. Bean wants that power.
- Mark hates Bean because Bean replaced him as Kaboom's mascot

### Unofficial

- Mark's appearance is just a mask, obscuring his frog-self
- Perhaps bean doesn't want the multiverse power, and just fears its potential
- The land of Kaboom is named Kaboomtopia
